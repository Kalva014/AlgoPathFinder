# Project Proposal: AlgoPathFinder
* This project visualizes different path finding algorithms by picking two different points on the graph and making walls.

# Importance and Interests:
* Gain a better understanding of run-times
* Gain a better understanding of data structures and algorithms

# Language/Tools/Technology:
* Languages: Python 3.x
  * Modules:
    * pygame
    * pygame_menu

# How to run:
 1. Download the pygame and pygame_menu modules
 2. Run the command python3 main.py
 3. Open the algorithms selection menu by pressing 'a'
 4. Choose which algorithm to use by pressing the number correlating to the algorithm on the keyboard
 5. Pick starting node on the graph by hovering over box with your mouse and pressing 's'
 6. Do the same method to pick the ending node by pressing 'e'
 7. To build walls press 'w' over the nodes
 8. Press space to run the algorithm
