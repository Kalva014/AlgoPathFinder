# Project Proposal: AlgoPathFinder
* This project visualizes different path finding algorithms by picking two different points on the graph and making walls.

# Importance and Interests:
* Gain a better understanding of run-times
* Gain a better understanding of data structures and algorithms

# Language/Tools/Technology:
* Languages: Python 3.x
  * Modules:
    * Matplotlib

# How to run:
 1. Download Matplotlib
 2. Run the command python3 main.py
 3. Choose which algorithm to use
 4. Gui opens and pick starting node on the graph by hovering over box with your mouse and pressing 's'
 5. Do the same method to pick the ending node by pressing 'e'
 6. To build walls press 'w' over the nodes
 7. Press space to run the algorithm
